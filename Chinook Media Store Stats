#In this project, I am using a database containing employees of a digital media store, customers, their invoices, and music the store sells. 
#I have asked used the below SQL to answer a few questions regarding the data.

#1. Show customers (their full names, customer ID, and their country) who are not in the US.
SELECT CustomerId, FirstName, LastName, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country <>'USA';

#2. Show only the customers from Brazil.
SELECT CustomerId, FirstName, LastName, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country = 'Brazil';

#3. Find the invoices of customers who are from Brazil. Show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, date of the invoice, and billing country.
SELECT cust.CustomerId, cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, inv.InvoiceId, inv.InvoiceDate, inv.BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices inv
LEFT JOIN chinook.customers cust
ON inv.CustomerId=cust.CustomerId
WHERE inv.BillingCountry='Brazil';

#4. Show the employees who are Sales Agents.
SELECT *
FROM chinook.employees
WHERE Title = 'Sales Support Agent';

#5. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoices table.
SELECT distinct BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices;

#6. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the sales agent's full name.
