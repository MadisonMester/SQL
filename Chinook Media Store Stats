#In this project, I am using a database containing employees of a digital media store, customers, their invoices, and music the store sells. 
#I have used the below SQL to answer a few questions regarding the data.

#1. Show customers (their full names, customer ID, and their country) who are not in the US.
SELECT CustomerId, FirstName, LastName, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country <>'USA';

#2. Show only the customers from Brazil.
SELECT CustomerId, FirstName, LastName, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country = 'Brazil';

#3. Find the invoices of customers who are from Brazil. Show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, date of the invoice, and billing country.
SELECT cust.CustomerId, cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, inv.InvoiceId, inv.InvoiceDate, inv.BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices inv
LEFT JOIN chinook.customers cust
ON inv.CustomerId=cust.CustomerId
WHERE inv.BillingCountry='Brazil';

#4. Show the employees who are Sales Agents.
SELECT *
FROM chinook.employees
WHERE Title = 'Sales Support Agent';

#5. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoices table.
SELECT distinct BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices;

#6. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the sales agent's full name.
SELECT emp.LastName, emp.FirstName, inv.InvoiceId
FROM chinook.customers cust
LEFT JOIN chinook.invoices inv
ON cust.CustomerId = inv.CustomerId
LEFT JOIN chinook.employees emp
ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId;

#7. Show the invoice total, customer name, country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.
SELECT emp.LastName, emp.FirstName, cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, cust.Country, inv.Total
FROM chinook.customers cust
JOIN chinook.invoices inv
ON cust.CustomerId = inv.CustomerId
JOIN chinook.employees emp
ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId;

#8. How many invoices were there in 2009?
SELECT count(*)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate LIKE '2009%';

#9. What are the total sales for 2009?
SELECT sum(Total)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate LIKE '2009%';

#10. Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT track.Name, inv.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.invoice_items inv
JOIN chinook.tracks track
ON inv.TrackId = track.TrackId;

#11. Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT t.Name as Track, ar.Name as Artist, i.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.invoice_items i
JOIN chinook.tracks t
ON i.TrackId = t.TrackId
JOIN chinook.albums a
ON t.AlbumId = a.AlbumId
JOIN chinook.artists ar
ON a.ArtistId = ar.ArtistId;

#12. Provide a query that shows all the tracks, and include the album name, media type, and genre.
SELECT t.Name as Track, a.Title, m.Name as Media, g.Name as Genre
FROM chinook.tracks t
JOIN chinook.albums a
ON t.AlbumId = a.AlbumId
JOIN chinook.media_types m
ON t.MediaTypeId = m.MediaTypeId
JOIN chinook.genres g
ON t.GenreId = g.GenreId;

#13. Show the total sales made by each sales agent.
SELECT e.FirstName, e.LastName, ROUND(sum(Total), 2) as 'Total Sales'
FROM chinook.employees e
JOIN chinook.customers c
ON e.EmployeeId = c.SupportRepId
JOIN chinook.invoices i
ON c.CustomerId = i.CustomerId
GROUP BY e.EmployeeId;

#14. Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?
SELECT e.FirstName, e.LastName, ROUND(sum(Total), 2) as 'Total Sales'
FROM chinook.employees e
JOIN chinook.customers c
ON e.EmployeeId = c.SupportRepId
JOIN chinook.invoices i
ON c.CustomerId = i.CustomerId
WHERE i.InvoiceDate LIKE '2009%'
GROUP BY e.EmployeeId
ORDER BY ROUND(sum(Total), 2) desc LIMIT 1;

#15. Show each track with its corresponding playlist.
SELECT p.Name as PlaylistName, t.Name as TrackName
FROM chinook.tracks t
JOIN chinook.playlist_track pt
ON t.trackId = pt.TrackId
JOIN chinook.playlists p
ON pt.PlaylistId = p.PlaylistId
ORDER BY p.Name;

#16. How many tracks does each playlist have?
SELECT p.Name as Playlist, count(trackId) as TrackCount
FROM chinook.playlists p
JOIN chinook.playlist_track pt
ON p.playlistid = pt.playlistid
GROUP BY p.Name;
