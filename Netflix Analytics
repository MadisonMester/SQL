#In this PostgreSQL code, I'm querying a database containing data from Netflix to answer questions about the data.

#1 How many movie titles are there in the database? (movies only, not tv shows)
SELECT count(*)
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type = 'Movie';

#2 When was the most recent batch of tv shows and/or movies added to the database?
SELECT MAX(date_added)
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info";

#3 List all the movies and tv shows in alphabetical order.
SELECT title
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
ORDER BY title ASC;

#4 Who was the Director for the movie Bright Star?
SELECT director
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" np
LEFT JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" nt
ON nt.show_id=np.show_id
WHERE nt.title='Bright Star';

What is the oldest movie in the database and what year was it made?
SELECT release_year, title
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE release_year <=
(SELECT MIN(release_year) FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" WHERE type='Movie')
AND type='Movie';
